# Neovim configuration

Heavily based off [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), and [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

I do not use nvim distros or frameworks, because I think it's best if I understand my own config and manage it myself.

I also do not use glyphs and try to configure plugins to not use them. This is so I do not have to install nerd fonts on every machine I use. Ideally, I would like my nvim setup to work fine on any machine with any terminal emulator.
